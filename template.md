## The Mission


### Must-have features


### Nice-to-have features


### Constraints

#### Imports

```python
# You CAN'T import like this:
import whatever_file
# You CAN'T import like this:
import .whatever_file
# You CAN'T import like this:
from .whatever_file.whatever_function
# You CAN'T import like this:
from .whatever_function
# You CAN'T import like this:
from whatever_file
```

```python
# You CAN import like this:
from whatever_file import whatever_function_or_class
```

#### Code style

- Each **class** should have a [`__str__()` method](https://medium.com/swlh/understanding-repr-and-str-in-python-65dd41538943).
- Each **function or class** has to be **typed**
- Each **function or class** has to contain a **docstring** formatted like this:

```python
def add(number_one: int, number_two: int) -> int:
    """
    Function that will perform the add operation between two numbers (in params).

    :param number_one: An int that will be added to the second parameter.
    :type int
    :param number_two: An int that will be added to the fist parameter.
    :type int
    :return: An int that is the result of the two params being added to each other.
    """
    result = number_one + number_two
    return result
```

- Your code should be **formatted** with [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/).
- Your code should be **commented**.
- Your code should be **cleaned of any commented unused code**.

#### Repo

- Your repo should only contain the files specified.
- Your README should be nice and complete (see the #Deliverables section below). Feel free to add more information.

Please keep the must-have version separate from the nice-to-have version by using a different branch on GitHub. Please specify that in your README too.

### Steps

It goes without saying, but please, **read through all of this before starting.**



Here are a list of popular IDEs or text editors to choose from:

- [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (IDE/Text editor)
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (IDE)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Text editor)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (Text editor)
- [vim](https://www.vim.org/) (Text editor)

Now, let's get to the heart of it!
And I repeat, **read through all of this before starting.**

#### 0. preparation

Create a GitHub repo called `challenge-openspace-classifier` and share it with your team if needed. In this repository create 2 files:

- `README.md`
- other .py files and repository structure

You're ready to go!


#### 1. First File


##### 1. First Object


## Deliverables

1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.
2. Pimp up the README file:
   - Description
   - Installation
   - Usage
   - (Visuals)
   - (Contributors)
   - (Timeline)
   - (Personal situation)
